        사랑은 자동차 추격전 같아, 실수로 들이박게 되지
        거친 사랑이라도 갈구하고 있어
        널 이렇게 만든 사람이 내가 아니라고 말해줘
        그런데도 너는 내 머릿속을 떠나지 않아
        여름에 흐르는 뜨거운 피
        그는 종이처럼 약한 마음을 찢기 위해 가졌던 거야

        She fell in love with the bass player's brother
        Playing cop under covers
        Slick hands like butter
        He had a buzz cut, August of '90
        She was a box-dyed blonde in a pipe dream
        Love is a car chase, crash into mistakes
        Sooner or later, you're packing a suitcase
        Singin' like
        Come on, baby
        Tell me that you hate me

        Heartache to heartache
        Give me some tough love, baby

        Hot blood in the summer*
        She fell in love with the bass player's brother
        Couple years down the gutter
        But Janie, you can't change him
        Like a haircut, Mr. America
        He took a paper heart just to tear it up
        Love is a car chase, crash into mistakes
        Sooner or later (you're packing up, packing up, packing up)
        Come on, baby
        Tell me that you hate me
